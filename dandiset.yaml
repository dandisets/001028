description: Tips of electrodes in a quadrupole array were either in contact with
  cell monolayer (0 mm distance) or were placed 1, 2, or 3 mm above it. Packet 2 was
  applied 10 times, starting from each electrode, to a total of 40 packets delivered.
  The amplitude of the first pulse in the packet was 6.4 kV. Electroporation of the
  cells was evaluated using 1 uM YoPro-1 cell impermeable fluorescent dye. The study
  was supported in part by R21EY034258 from the National Eye Institute to A.G.P
